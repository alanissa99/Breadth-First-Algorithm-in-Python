# Breadth-First-Algorithm-in-Python
Implementing a breadth first algorithm in python (d3.py)
Code looks at giving the shortest path between two 3 letter words (all words are to exist in a given dictionary). 
For the code to work, one must replace the txt file (it is a dictionary containing three letter words) in the code since github wont allow files over 25mb.
